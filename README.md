# AttackOfTheSpaceAliens
This is a game made for the GameBoy Advance.

The user can use the up, down, left, and right keys to control a spaceship that moves around the screen. The user can also press A to shoot bullets at aliens and B to shoot mega-bullets. 
In order to win, the player must defeat all of the big aliens by shooting them with bullets. The big aliens are also shooting mini aliens at the player, so you must either shoot or dodge them!
The player must also avoid the yellow stars on the screen. 
There are three levels. 

If the big aliens lose all of their lives first, you win!
If you lose all of your lives first, you lose.

Good luck!
